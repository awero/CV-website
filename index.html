            Education:<br />
            The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp<br />
            100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023<br />
            During my studies, I gained a strong foundation in web development
            and Python programming. I learned how to build responsive websites,
            work with APIs, and create dynamic web applications. I also
            developed a solid understanding of programming fundamentals, data
            structures, and algorithms. I am now continuing my education as a
            fullstack developer, with a focus on expanding my skills and
            knowledge in the field.

          <h2>Project Title</h2>
          <p>
            This was my first website project, which I completed as part of my
            web development training. The goal was to create a simple,
            responsive website that showcased my skills in HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript.
            <br />
            Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
            <br />
            Role: Sole Developer
            <br />
            Challenges: One of the biggest challenges I faced was ensuring that
            the website was fully responsive and looked great on all devices. To
            overcome this, I used CSS media queries to adjust the layout and
            styling based on the screen size.
            <br />
            Results: While this project was primarily a learning exercise, I was
            able to gain valuable experience working with HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, and I received positive feedback from my instructor and
            peers.
